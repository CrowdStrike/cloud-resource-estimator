# CrowdStrike CWP / Horizon Benchmark Utilities
These utilities have been developed to assist you in calculating the overall size of a cloud deployment.

+ [Running an audit](#running-an-audit)
+ [Notes](#notes)
+ [Cloud Shell documentation](#cloud-shell-documentation)
+ [License and Questions](#license)

## Running an audit
+ Login to your cloud provider and then connect to Cloud Shell.
    - If asked, select `BASH` for your environment.
+ Execute the following command: 
```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrowdStrike/Cloud-Benchmark/main/benchmark.sh | /bin/bash
```

Results will be calculated and displayed directly to your terminal.

## Notes
- Scripts can be executed directly as shown above, or downloaded and then executed at a later time.
    + Don't forget to set execution permissions on `benchmark.sh` if you decide to download and execute later.
    + Required Python dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file residing in the directory for that cloud provider.
        - Install these dependencies with the command:
          ```shell
          pip3 install -r requirements.txt
          ```
          *or*
          
          ```shell
          python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
          ```
- Downloaded audit scripts are developed using Python 3 and BASH.
- Audit scripts are removed after the process completes.
- As part of the audit, necessary dependencies are installed based upon cloud provider.

## Cloud Shell documentation
Cloud Shell is an online development and operations environment accessible anywhere with your browser. AWS, Azure
and GCP all support Cloud Shell environments and provide documentation for using these environments.
